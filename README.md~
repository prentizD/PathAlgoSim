# PathAlgoSim
This project is written in C and the goal is to visualize a variety of different algorithms (for example Dijkstra's algorithm for path finding).
For the visualization the raylib library is used:
https://www.raylib.com/
In short the raylib is a easy to use lightweighted game engine without the need of a integrated development environment.

## Setup/Build/Launch

Requirements:

Linux:
- gcc 
- install raylib (see: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux) (Tested on V4.0 and V5.0)
- (linux requires only the \include directory and the main.c file)

## Linux:

source path_to_emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
make
python3 -m http.server 8080
